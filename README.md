# Predictive-Maintenance-with-Machine-Learning
Developed a machine learning predictive maintenance model for industrial equipment by integrating sensor telemetry, error logs, and maintenance records. Engineered time-series features and built classification models to predict machinery component failures, enabling proactive maintenance and reducing operationalÂ downtime.
